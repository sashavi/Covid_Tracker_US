# Covid_Tracker_US
A visualization and Non-Linear Regression model of Covid-19 in the US

By tracking Coronavirus cases across the US we can see the areas most impacted by the virus. We can also create models to predict how the virus will develop in the upcoming months. These models can be used to manage response efforts and allocate resources to the appropriate places.

Below is a gif which show the development of COVID cases and deaths as of 11/14/2020.

If we visualize all deaths across time we can get a sense of the type of model we want to build.
